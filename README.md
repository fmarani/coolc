COOL

*work in progress*

A compiler for COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language) written in Python. Explained here: https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers

I wrote this in Python from scratch, after having written it in Java, so I could learn every step. I would strongly advise you not to copy this to solve the class quizzes!!!

My aim was to make it as readable as possible, and demistify a bit how compilers work. I would have loved to find something like this when I was learning compilers, so I leave this here for others to read and hopefully find it easier to write their own.
